# Computer_Vision_Playground

Welcome to Computer Vision Playground , this is a collection of OpenCV tutorials and exercises that I practiced on Google Colab. Itâ€™s a hands-on playground where I learned and experimented with basic to intermediate computer vision concepts.

**WHAT IT CONTAINS?**

This repo holds practical exercises, sample codes, and step-by-step explorations of various computer vision concepts using OpenCV. Each notebook builds on core OpenCV functions, paired with visual examples and in-line explanations.
