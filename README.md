# Computer_Vision_Playground

Welcome to Computer Vision Playground , this is a collection of OpenCV tutorials and exercises that I practiced on Google Colab. It’s a hands-on playground where I learned and experimented with basic to intermediate computer vision concepts.


## Topics covered

This repo holds practical exercises, sample codes, and step-by-step explorations of various computer vision concepts using OpenCV. Each notebook builds on core OpenCV functions, paired with visual examples and in-line explanations.


This repo covers a wide range of core and applied computer vision topics, organized roughly like this:

- **Basic Image Operations**  
  Reading, resizing, rotating images; creating slideshows; handling multiple images.

- **Drawing & Annotation**  
  Drawing lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons, and adding text over images.

- **Image Processing & Transformations**  
  Arithmetic and bitwise operations, affine and perspective transformations, contour detection, masking, histogram computation.

- **Color Manipulation**  
  Switching between color spaces (BGR, HSV, etc.), splitting and merging color channels.

- **Real‑time Computer Vision**  
  Capturing from camera; hand tracking using MediaPipe and CVZone.
